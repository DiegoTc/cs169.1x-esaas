CS169.1x Engineering Software as a Service - November 2014

This repo contain my solutions to a number of the homework problems put to the class.  Each .rb file contains a part of that week's homework, complete with comments that indicate what the problems ask of the student.  I try to engage in paired programming when I can, so all of the most face-meltingly beautiful code can no-doubt be attributed to my fellow students.  XD
